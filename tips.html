    <h2>Advice for myself (and maybe someone else)</h2>

    <p>I tend to get lost very often, so I'm writing some advice for my future self while I have the mental clarity to do so. I think it's important to have a stable state of mind, as before we are mathematicians, we are human beings who are destined to experience all sorts of things that are not as ideal as mathematics-we experience growth, maturity, senility, death and all things in between, whether it be of ourselves or of others, and we experience the accompanying pleasures and suffering. This advice is based on my crude interpretation of Buddhist philosophy.</p>

    <h3>Life is suffering</h3>

    <p>The manner in which these emotion-provoking events are presented is unpredictable and can be very confusing. Sometimes you feel like the unluckiest person, and the more you try to get things under your control, the situation may get even more chaotic. This forms a vicious cycle and brings you to a dark place that can be hard to get out of. But it is important to know that suffering is an inevitable part of life that is not unique to you.</p>

    <h3>There is a cause</h3>

    <p>These unwanted events are not inherently malicious. It is our cravings that cause suffering. This does not mean we should avoid any desires; that is impossible. Rather, we should be mindful of the true cause of suffering.</p>

    <h3>There is an end</h3>

    <p>Whenever you encounter something unpleasant, try to take a step back and give an objective diagnosis of what is happening. Not overly optimistic, not overly pessimistic, but just the way it is. This is surprisingly relieving, and it is possible to alleviate suffering through knowing the truth.</p>

    <h3>There is a path</h3>

    <p>You have to actively practice balancing various aspects of life to end suffering. This also implies that you don't suddenly achieve tranquility in life; rather, it is a gradual process. So don't feel bad that you aren't the perfect version of yourself, because that never happens.</p>

    <p>Doing too much or too little of something hurts you in the same way, so you have to try to hit the sweet spot. Overall, have an objective and truthful view of your own life.</p>
