    <h1>Undergraduate Algebra & Geometry Seminar</h1>

    <p>Organized by Seungjae Yun. This seminar was funded 500,000 KRW through Professor <a href="https://www.math.snu.ac.kr/~okoert/">Otto van Koert</a>.</p>

    <p>Title: Playing with surfaces</p>
    <p>Speaker: Anthony Hojin Lee <a href="https://antleee7.github.io">homepage</a></p>
    <p>Abstract: The talk will revolve around classical theorems in algebraic geometry. I will first introduce Mumford's proof of the famous fact that every smooth cubic surface contains exactly 27 lines. If time permits, I will also prove that there are 12 rational cubic curves that pass through 8 general points in the plane. I will assume very basic familiarity with projective spaces.</p>

    <p>Title: Rectifiable Currents and the Plateau Problem</p>
    <p>Speaker: Hyunjun Lee</p>
    <p>Abstract: The purpose of the talk is to provide an intuitive understanding of how currents can be used to represent rectifiable sets and endow them with a structure of convergence. I will go through the concepts and briefly present how currents were used in solving the Plateau existence problem. Prerequisites will be kept to a minimum.</p>

    <p>Title: Intoduction to local fields and applications of Frobenius element</p>
    <p>Speaker: Hyomin Park</p>
    <p>Abstract: The seminar has two main purposes. First one is to introduce local fields and show two basic (also powerful) properties of extensions of local fields. After presenting a general diagram for galois extension of number fields (involving local fields), I will introduce the Frobenius element with some friendly examples.</p>

    <p>Title: An Invitation to $\infty$-categories</p>
    <p>Speaker: Seungjae Yun</p>
    <p>Abstract: $\infty$-categories arose from the study of model categories and has now become a widely used setup in modern mathematics. The virtue is that they keep track of all the (homotopy) structure on the space of morphisms, so that one may view it as a refinement of the classical setup. This will be the first in a series of talks going through the basic constructions in derived algebraic geometry. Prerequisites for this talk will be basic category theory.</p>

    <p>Title: An Introduction to Toric Varieties</p>
    <p>Speaker: Donghae Lee</p>
    <p>Abstract: Toric varieties and symplectic toric manifolds are introduced as geometric objects equipped with torus actions in the algebraic and symplectic settings, respectively. Their correspondence is described via Delzant’s theorem. No background in algebraic or symplectic geometry is assumed.</p>

    <p>Title: The ADE Classification</p>
    <p>Speaker: Anthony Hojin Lee</p>
    <p>Abstract: In this talk, I will introduce the simply laced Dynkin diagrams and the so-called ADE classification of various mathematical objects via such diagrams. Some instances that fall under this classification include simply laced Lie algebras, finite subgroups of the spatial rotation group and $\mathrm{SU}(2)$, and consequently the du Val singularities in algebraic geometry.</p>

    <p>Title: Introduction to adeles and ideles: relation to classical theorems</p>
    <p>Speaker: Hyomin Park</p>
    <p>Abstract: In this talk, first I will briefly summarize 4 classical theorems of algebraic number theory(strong approximation of number field, finiteness of class number, Dirichlet's unit theorem, Artin's product formula). Next I will introduce the definition of adeles and ideles, observing how their structural theorems include those 4 classical theorems.</p>

    <p>Title: Spin Structures and Orientations in Floer Cohomology</p>
    <p>Speaker: Donghae Lee</p>
    <p>Abstract: In this talk, I will introduce various definitions of Stiefel–Whitney classes and spin structures. Then I will explain how to assign orientations to moduli spaces used in defining Floer cohomology for spin Lagrangian submanifolds.</p>

    <p>Title: An Invitation to Derived Algebraic Geometry</p>
    <p>Speaker: Seungjae Yun</p>
    <p>Abstract: As a sequel of the previous talk on infinite categories, we will discover how they are applied to derived algebraic geometry. We will aim to understand how derived algebraic geometry overcomes some of the main difficulties in classical algebraic geometry, especially for moduli spaces. This talk will require background on classical/higher stack theory. However for those new to this subject, I will try to explain how to imagine them in a heuristic way.</p>
