    <h1>Undergraduate Algebra & Geometry Seminar</h1>

    <p>Title: Playing with surfaces</p>
    <p>Speaker: Anthony Hojin Lee [<a href="https://antleee7.github.io">homepage</a>]</p>
    <p>Abstract: The talk will revolve around classical theorems in algebraic geometry. I will first introduce Mumford's proof of the famous fact that every smooth cubic surface contains exactly 27 lines. If time permits, I will also prove that there are 12 rational cubic curves that pass through 8 general points in the plane. I will assume very basic familiarity with projective spaces.</p>

    <p>Title: Rectifiable Currents and the Plateau Problem</p>
    <p>Speaker: Hyunjun Lee</p>
    <p>Abstract: The purpose of the talk is to provide an intuitive understanding of how currents can be used to represent rectifiable sets and endow them with a structure of convergence. I will go through the concepts and briefly present how currents were used in solving the Plateau existence problem. Prerequisites will be kept to a minimum.</p>

    <p>Title: Intoduction to local fields and applications of Frobenius element</p>
    <p>Speaker: Hyomin Park</p>
    <p>Abstract: The seminar has two main purposes. First one is to introduce local fields and show two basic (also powerful) properties of extensions of local fields. After presenting a general diagram for galois extension of number fields (involving local fields), I will introduce the Frobenius element with some friendly examples.</p>

    <p>Title: An Invitation to $\infty$-categories</p>
    <p>Speaker: Seungjae Yun</p>
    <p>Abstract: $\infty$-categories arose from the study of model categories and has now become a widely used setup in modern mathematics. The virtue is that they keep track of all the (homotopy) structure on the space of morphisms, so that one may view it as a refinement of the classical setup. This will be the first in a series of talks going through the basic constructions in derived algebraic geometry. Prerequisites for this talk will be basic category theory.</p>

    <p>Title: An Introduction to Toric Varieties</p>
    <p>Speaker: Donghae Lee</p>
    <p>Abstract: Toric varieties and symplectic toric manifolds are introduced as geometric objects equipped with torus actions in the algebraic and symplectic settings, respectively. Their correspondence is described via Delzantâ€™s theorem. No background in algebraic or symplectic geometry is assumed.</p>
