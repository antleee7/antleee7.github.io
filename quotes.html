  <p>Simone Weil was a French philosopher. She also was André Weil's younger sister. These are some of her quotes that I enjoyed reading.</p>
  
    <h2>From <i>Reflections on the Right Use of School Studies with a View to the Love of God</i></h2>
    <ul class="clean-list">
        <li>Students must (...) work without any wish to gain good marks, to pass examinations, to win school successes; without any reference to their natural abilities and tastes; applying themselves equally to all their tasks, with the idea that each one will help to form in them the habit of that attention which is the substance of prayer.</li>
        <li>The intelligence can only be led by desire. For there to be desire, there must be pleasure and joy in the work.</li>
        <li>Twenty minutes of concentrated, untired attention is infinitely better than three hours of the kind of frowning application that leads us to say with a sense of duty done: "I have worked well!" But, in spite of all appearances, it is also far more difficult. Something in our soul has a far more violent repugnance for true attention than the flesh has for bodily fatigue.</li>
        <li>Our thought should be in relation to all particular and already formulated thoughts, as a man on a mountain who, as he looks forward, sees also below him, without actually looking at them, a great many forests and plains. Above all our thought should be empty, waiting, not seeking anything, but ready to receive in its naked truth the object that is to penetrate it.</li>
        <li>We do not obtain the most precious gifts by going in search of them but by waiting for them. Man cannot discover them by his own powers, and if he sets out to seek for them he will find in their place counterfeits of which he will be unable to discern the falsity.</li>
        <li>Academic work is one of those fields containing a pearl so precious that it is worth while to sell all our possessions, keeping nothing for ourselves, in order to be able to acquire it.</li>
    </ul>


    <h2> From <i>Lectures on Philosophy</i></h2>
    <ul class="clean-list">
        <li>Face to face with a work of beauty, (...) we forget our own existence. We believe that works of art would keep all their value even if men no longer existed.</li>
        <li>One does not surpass something beautiful; while one does go further than some idea or other.</li>
        <li>The moral value of art: It teaches us that mind can come down into nature. Morality itself tells us to act according to thoughts that are true. Beauty is a witness that the ideal can become a reality.</li>
    </ul>
